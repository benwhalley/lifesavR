# lifesavr


This is WIP


# Contributing

- Work on branch `main` (for the moment) and this is published to https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/
- Add .rmd files (lowercase extension)
- Knit them to html (pref using a setup matching or on the school rstudio server)
- Add changes to Rmd and html in separate commits (to `main` branch)



# Style guide

Again WIP

- use `_first-chunk.R` to load packages and set defaults

- use https://styler.r-lib.org/ and https://style.tidyverse.org/ to tidy things?

- every `dplyr` verb and `ggplot` layer must be on a new line
