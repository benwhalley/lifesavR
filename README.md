# lifesavr

This is WIP

# Contributing

- Work on branch `main` (for the moment) and this is published to https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/
- Add .rmd files (lowercase extension)
- Knit them to html (pref using a setup matching or on the school rstudio server)
- Add changes to Rmd and html in separate commits (to `main` branch)

# Style guide (WIP)

- use `_first-chunk.R` to load packages and set defaults
- use https://styler.r-lib.org/ and https://style.tidyverse.org/ to tidy things (there's an R Studio plugin)
- every `dplyr` verb and `ggplot` layer must be on a new line

## Videos

1. Write the script for the video with a show/hide button
1. Record the video and add it above the script button (see session-1.rmd for an HTML example)

## Language

* Show rather than tell
  * Good: **Using variables lets us store calculations for later.**
  * Bad: **It is important to understand what a variable is in R.**
