> The lingering mind/The lingering mind: alertness and readiness to meet the situation. (Zanshin)

Zanshin is a continuing state of alertness and readiness to meet the situation. To stretch our metaphor a little â€” when working with data it's 
important to remain open to alternative explanations and to provide the best possible summary of our data.


- Sub-setting data: sensitivity analysis for outliers (filter, group_by)
- Summary tables to reveal patterns in data (use Simpson's paradox as teaching example)
- Facets in graphs; ggsave






# Making new datasets with `filter`

Sometimes it's useful to create copies or subsets of your data. 

```{r}
idealdiamonds <- diamonds %>% filter(cut=="Ideal")
idealdiamonds %>% 
  head
```

Now show when we use this new dataframe in a plot:

```{r}
idealdiamonds %>% ggplot(aes(carat, price)) + geom_jitter()
```
