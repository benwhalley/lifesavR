To get everyone off to the same start we have created a script that copies
some files into your home folder on the RStudio server.

To run this script, we just copy and paste the following line into the Console:

```{r, eval=F}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/lifesavR/main/bootstrap.R")
```
