- Continuous, categorical and text data are all common in psychology
- Internally, R stores columns of data using different *data types*.
- R uses data-types as a clue to set *defaults* (e.g. for graphs)
- Sometimes we need to convert between types
- E.g., sometimes categorical data is (wrongly) stored as a numeric column
