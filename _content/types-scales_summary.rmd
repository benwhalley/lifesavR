- Continuous, categorical and text (string) data are all common in psychology
- Internally, R stores data in a number of different data *types*.
- Sometimes we need to convert between data types
- For example, sometimes categorical data can get stored as numeric
- R uses data-types as a clue to set *defaults* (e.g. for graphs)
