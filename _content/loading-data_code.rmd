# REMEMBER
# This code relies on you first uploading your CSV data
# to the right folder on the RStudio server
# if you have problems, check the other steps in the video first


# Step 1.
# We asked you to download the CSV file from here:
# https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/lifesavr/shootings.csv
# And save it to your Desktop folder.


# Step 2.
# Then you needed to upload it to the same place as your Rmd file on the server


# Step 3.
# Then you can read the CSV and assign it to a new variable,
# called `shootings`
shootings <- read_csv('shootings.csv')


# now we can inspect this dataset like any other:
shootings %>% glimpse
```
