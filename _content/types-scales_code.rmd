```{r, eval=F}

# see a list of columns in the dataset, and their types
iris %>% glimpse



# make a scatter plot with two continous axes
# both wt and mpg are numeric variables
# so this works well
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) +
    geom_point()   



# try and make a boxplot with `am` as the x axis
# but because `am` is stored as a numeric variable and
# not categorical the scale of the x axis is wrong
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(am, mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot()


# re-draw the plot, but converting `am` to a factor/categorical
# variable first. Now the x axis looks correct
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(factor(am), mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
