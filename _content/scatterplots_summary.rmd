- A scatterplot shows the *relationship* between two *continuous* variables (columns)
- Each observation (row) must have at least two values (columns)
- These define the position on the x and y axes of the plot
- Use `ggplot()`
- `aes(x = ..., y = ...)` says which *columns* and creates axes
- `geom_point()` adds the points
