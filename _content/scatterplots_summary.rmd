- A scatterplot shows the *relationship* between two variables
- Each observation must have two *continuous* values
- These define the position on the x and y axes of the plot
- Use `ggplot()` to make plots
- `aes(x = ..., y = ...)` says which *columns* of data to use
- `geom_point()` adds each pair of values as a point
