By loading 'packages', you can add functions and datasets to R.

Packages are a powerful feature which allow R to be extended to run almost

A package (sometimes called a library) is an extension to R that
adds new functions and/or datasets.

Packages are loaded using the `library()` function.

The first function you ran above was `library(tidyverse)`.  This loaded additional functions
you need to make a scatter plot, and also the diamonds data.


**The `tidyverse` package is so fundamental to this course that `library(tidyverse)` is
likely to be the first line of R code in the first chunk in all you RMarkdown files.**
