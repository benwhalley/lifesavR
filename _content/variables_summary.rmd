- In R, a **variable** is the name for a *container* which *stores data*.
- Columns in a dataset sometimes get called variables too (but this is different)
- Make variables with `<-` (the *assignment operator*)
- Values to the right of `<-` are stored in the variable named on left
- Give variables short, descriptive names. Don't use spaces or capitals
