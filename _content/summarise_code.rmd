```{r}
# use function mean() to summarise mpg column
# the result is a data.frame with the a single column named 'mean_mpg'
fuel %>%
  summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))

# if you omit the column name, the summarised column is named after summary function
# this produces column names which can be awkward to process later in a pipeline
# for example:
fuel %>%
  summarise(mean(mpg))

# median mpg (rather than mean)
fuel %>%
  summarise(median_mpg = median(mpg))

# standard deviation
fuel %>%
  summarise(sd_mpg = sd(mpg))

# summarise two columns at once 
# the mean and sd functions are separated with a comma
# the resulting data frame is stored in a variable called mtcar
fuel_summary <- fuel %>%
  summarise(M = mean(mpg), SD = sd(mpg))


# see the stored summary
fuel_summary

# remember, this summary is still a new dataset; you could do more processing on it in extra steps if needed



# combining summarise and filter
development %>% 
  filter(continent=="Asia") %>% 
  summarise(Average_life_expectancy = mean(life_expectancy))
