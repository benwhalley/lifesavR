- RMarkdown documents combine 'chunks' of R code with regular text
- RMarkdown files end with "`.rmd`" or "`.Rmd`"
- To make a chunk type: `Ctrl + Alt + I` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘ + Alt + I` (Mac)

---

- To run a line type `Ctrl + ↵` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘ + ↩` (Mac)
- Run *part of a line* select it first, then use the same shortcut

---

- Anything outside a chunk is just narrative (ordinary) text and *not* treated as code.
