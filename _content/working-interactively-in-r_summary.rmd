- RMarkdown documents combine 'chunks' of R code with regular text
- This means you can keep notes and explanations right next to where you process and anayse data
- RMarkdown files end with "`.rmd`" or "`.Rmd`"
- A ***statement*** is one of more lines of code which R knows are linked

- Make a new chunk: `Ctrl + Alt + I` or `⌘ + Alt + I` (Mac)
- Run a statement: `Ctrl + ↵` (or `⌘ + ↩` Mac)
- Run the whole chunk: `Shift + Ctrl + ↵` (or `Shift + ⌘ + ↩` Mac)
