- `filter()` selects *rows* from a dataset
- We define criteria to match rows we want
- To match exactly, we use `==` (two equality symbols) 
- Other filters like `<` or `>` are also useful
- Combine multiple filters to be more specific
- Upper/lower case, spaces, and punctuation all matter (watch out!)
