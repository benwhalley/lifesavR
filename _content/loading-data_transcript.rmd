In a lot of these workshops we use datasets that are built-in to R. This is a convenient way to illustrate the points we
make.

[opening and glance some built in data like gapminder, iris, mtcars etc]

Normally, though, you will need to load your own data.

R can read data from two places:

- A URL (web address), if the data file is available on the internet somewhere
- A file on computer that R is running on

The link below is a URL (web address) of a file containing data about US police shootings.

- [https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/lifesavr/shootings.csv](https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/lifesavr/shootings.csv)

The final part of the url tells us the name of the file: `shootings.csv`

The final 3 (sometimes 4) letters of the filename is called the file extension.

Here the file *extension* is `.csv`, which stands for 'comma separated values' or CSV.

CSV is a common data type. Most data-oriented programmes (e.g. Excel, Open Office or SPSS) can read and write `.csv` files, so it's a good choice for storing and sharing data.

If you click on the file link you'll see the first line is a list of column names separated by commas.

The remaining lines contain rows of data matching the column headings. For example, the value of the `arms_category` column in row 1 is `Guns`.

The `read_csv()` function reads a CSV file, and converts it to a `data.frame`, which is the format we use in R.

We can use `read_csv()` to load data from either a file, or over the internet, which is what we'll do in the next section.
