```{r, eval=F}
# look at the variables in the CO2 data
# which is about different grasses use of CO2 (uptake) 
# under cold/normal conditions
CO2 %>% glimpse

# make a plot comparing CO2 update of types of grass
CO2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(Type, uptake)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# using filter with summarise to get the numbers from the graph
CO2 %>% 
  filter(Type=="Quebec") %>% 
  summarise(mean(uptake))

# (but this could get repetitive)


# instead we use group_by to make multiple summaries, 
# one for each category
CO2 %>%
  group_by(Type) %>%
  summarise(mean(uptake))

# group by more than one variable at once
CO2 %>%
  group_by(Type, Treatment) %>%
  summarise(mean(uptake))

# calculate the mean and standard deviation in a single step
# (this adds two columns to our output for mean and SD)
CO2 %>%
  group_by(Type, Treatment) %>%
  summarise(mean(uptake), sd(uptake))

# give the new column a name of our choosing
CO2 %>%
  summarise(average_uptake = mean(uptake))
