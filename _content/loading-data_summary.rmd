- Often we want to load data into R, rather than use built-in datasets.
- The preferred format for data files in R is comma-separated value (CSV).
- A CSV file usually includes column names in the first row; each row after that contains the data.
- CSV files should always end in `'.csv'` (this is the file extension).
- CSV data can be read using the `read_csv()` function.
- You can load CSV data from an internet address (URL) or a file uploaded to the R Studio server.
