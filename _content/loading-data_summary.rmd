File formats:

- R can load almost any data format
- We recommend comma-separated value (CSV) files
- CSV filenames always end in `.csv`
- You can also open CSV files in Excel

Loading data:

- Always use `read_csv()` (NOT `read.csv()`).
- Upload your file to the RStudio server first (use the **Files** pane)
- Save/upload data to the **same folder as your `.rmd` file**

Remember to:

- Assign (`<-`) the result of `read_csv()` to a variable.
- Give the variable a descriptive name.
- Use `glimpse` or the **Environment** pane to check imported data.
