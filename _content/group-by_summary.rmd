- Datasets often contain categorical variables
- We often want to compare statistics (like averages) *between* categories
- The `group_by` function is a quick way to combine filtering and summarising
- `group_by` creates a *grouped dataframe*
- Adding `group_by()` to a pipeline runs the subsequent steps *once for each group*.
- The result is always a new dataframe
