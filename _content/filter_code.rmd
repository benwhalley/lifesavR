```{r, eval=F}
# load example data
library(psydata)

# filter on a categorical variable
# == mean 'match exactly'
development %>% 
  filter(country == "Kenya")

# this doesn't match any rows because we don't use a capital K
development %>% 
  filter(country=="kenya")

# filtering on a numeric variable
development %>% filter(year > 2000)


# combining multiple filters makes things more specific
development %>%
  filter(country=="Kenya") %>%
  filter(year > 2000)

# assign filtered data to a new variable for re-use later on
# if you don't store the data, it is displayed but then lost
development.europe <- development %>% 
  filter(continent=="Europe") %>% 
  filter(year > 1980)

# show the stored subset
development.europe

# make a plot with the subset
development.europe %>% 
    ggplot(aes(gdp_per_capita, life_expectancy)) + 
  geom_point()
