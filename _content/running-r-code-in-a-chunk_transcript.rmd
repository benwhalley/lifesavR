There are three ways to run R code within a chunk. The first is to run a complete line of code. You can
see here that our cursor is on line 12. The cursor can be anywhere on that line. To run the line, press
<span class="keyshape">Ctrl</span> + <span class="keyshape">↵</span> on Windows or Linux, or <span
class="keyshape">⌘</span> + <span class="keyshape">↩</span> on a Mac.

You'll see some output beneath the chunk that you don't need to worry about for now, but one of the effects of running
this code is to load a dataset about diamonds.

The cursor has been automatically positioned online 13. Lines 13 to 15 are actually part of the same statement. We use the
same keys, <span class="keyshape">Ctrl</span> + <span class="keyshape">↵</span>, to run these lines, which generate a
scatter plot using the diamonds dataset. Don't worry how these statements work for now.

The second way to run code is to select only the parts you want to execute. If you select just the word diamonds on line
13 and run that, you will see that it does something different. This prints the contents of the diamonds data. Because
the dataset is large, it just prints the first few rows.

Finally, you often want to run all of the code in a chunk. This can be done by pressing the green arrow on the right hand side of the chunk. Another way to run all of the code is to position your cursor anywhere within the chunk and press
<span class="keyshape">Ctrl</span> + <span class="keyshape">⇧</span> + <span class="keyshape">↵</span> (Windows, Linux) or
<span class="keyshape">⌘</span> + <span class="keyshape">⇧</span> + <span class="keyshape">↩</span> (Mac).
