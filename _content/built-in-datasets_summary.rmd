### Datasets are like spreadsheets. They have have:

- multiple rows, with one row per *observation*
- multiple columns; each column has a name.
- columns also (sometimes) get called *variables*; this can be confusing


### Where are datasets?

- R has some built-in datasets as learning examples
- The `psydata` includes datasets used in this course
- Later on, we will import data from files (e.g. actual spreadsheets)


### Exploring and checking data

- View a whole dataset by typing its name and running it in a code chunk
- `glimpse()` shows a list of all the columns, plus a few of the datapoints
- The **Environment** pane shows a spreadsheet-like view of the data
