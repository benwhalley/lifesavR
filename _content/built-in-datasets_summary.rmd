### Datasets are like spreadsheets. They have have:

- multiple columns; each with a name.
- multiple rows, one per observation
- we sometimes call dataset columns *variables* because they relate to variables in our studies


### Where are datasets

- R has built-in datasets as learning examples
- Some packages contain example datasets too
- Later on, we will import data from files (e.g. actual spreadsheets)


### Exploring and checking data

- View a dataset by typing its name and running it in a chunk
- `head()`shows the first few rows
- `glimpse()` shows a list of all the columns, plus some of the data
- The **Environment** pane shows a spreadsheet-like view
