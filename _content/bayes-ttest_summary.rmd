- t-tests *compare the average score for two groups*
- A Bayes Factor (from a t-test) compares two different hypotheses:  
  - H1 (there groups are different) vs. 
  - H0 (the groups are identical)

- Use the `ttestBF` function in R  (load `BayesFactor` first)
- Bayes Factors range from zero to infinity
- Large Bayes Factors are evidence FOR a difference
