- Rmarkdown files are a mixture of R code chunks and regular text

- Markdown symbols allow you to format the regular text in your R Markdown files.
  - `#` creates a first level heading (the largest size)
  - `##` creates a second level heading (next largest). Using `###` and `####` makes even smaller headings.
  - `**bold text**` makes **bold text**
  - `*italic text*` makes *italic text*

- Press the `Knit` button to run your R chunks, format your markdown and combined them into an output document.
