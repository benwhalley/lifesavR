- Summarising data means reduce lots of numbers to a smaller number
- For example, the mean is a summary which tells us about the central tendency
- `summarise()` allows us to use different *summary functions* like mean, median or standard deviation
- It reduces many rows into a smaller number (sometimes a single number)
- `summarise()` returns a new dataset
- You can store the result in a variable, or use it in later code
- You can use `filter` and `summarise` together
