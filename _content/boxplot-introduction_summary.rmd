- Boxplots are useful for comparing categorised data
- Use `aes()` with `ggplot()` to choose a categorical column as the x axis
- `geom_boxplot()` draws boxes and whiskers for each category
- The box describes the [*interquartile range*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zx7rk7h/revision/2)
- The midpoint is the *median*
- Individual points show *outliers* in the data
