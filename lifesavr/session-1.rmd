- Use this document to complete and record your answers to the exercises in each session.
- Edit the code and text below to save your work

## An example plot

The following chunk creates a scatter-plot of a built-in data set that contains information about diamonds. By the end of
the second session, you will have learnt how to create similar plots.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point()
```
