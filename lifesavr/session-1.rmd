## An example plot

The following chunk creates a scatterplot of a built-in data set that contains information about diamonds. By the end of
the second session, you will have learnt how to create similar plots.

```{r diamonds-plot}
library(tidyverse)
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Variables

This chunk runs the calculation `40 + 2`, assigns the result to the variable `meaningoflife`, and then prints the value
of the variable.

```{r life}
meaningoflife <- 40 + 2
meaningoflife
```

## Exercise 1

1. Create a chunk below these instructions
1. Inside the chunk, write a line of code which adds together the numbers 9, 4, 55 and 2, and assigns the result to a variable named `sum`.
1. Run the the line of code you have written
