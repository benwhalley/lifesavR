## An example plot

The following chunk creates a scatterplot of a built-in data set that contains information about diamonds. By the end of
the second session, you will have learnt how to create similar plots.

```{r diamonds-plot}
library(tidyverse)
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(carat, price, colour = clarity)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Exercise 1

1. Create a chunk
1. Inside the chunk, create a variable called `myfirstvariable` which stores the result of the addition `2 + 2`
1. Run the chunk

```{r myfirstchunk}
myfirstvariable <- 2 + 2
```
