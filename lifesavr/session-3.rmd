# lifesaveR: Workbook 3

This R Markdown document is your workbook for session three of the lifesaveR module.

# Making boxplots

## Exercise 1

Use the `iris` dataset to create a boxplot with `Species` on the x-axis and `Sepal.Width` on the y-axis.

# Using colour

## Exercise 2

Using the `development` data from `psydata`, create a scatterplot with `life_expectancy` on the x-axis, `gdp_per_capita`
on the y-axis, and `continent` in colour.

# Using different types of data and visual scales

## Exercise 3

Describe the 4 ways in which quantitative researchers might use the word 'variable'?

## Exercise 4

1. Use `glimpse()` to check the data types of the `mpg` and the `diamonds` datasets.
2. Use the output to answer the questions in the worksheet.

## Exercise 5

Using the `fuel` dataset, make a boxplot showing miles per gallon on the y-axis, and number of gears on the x-axis.

# Using `group_by()` to make a summary table and compare groups

## Exercise 6

Replace the `?` in the code below to to calculate the median weight lost for men and women undergoing FIT and MI in the
`funimagery` dataset:

```{r, eval=F}
? %>%
  group_by(?, ?) %>%
  summarise( ?(weight_lost_end_trt) )
```

## Exercise 7

Use `group_by()` and `summarise()` with the built-in `iris` dataset to calculate the mean `Sepal.Length` for each
`Species` of flower.

## Exercise 8

# Check your knowledge

## What is the difference between a `dbl` and an `ord`/`fct`?

## Give an example of when the difference between `dbl` and `fct` matters when making a plot

## How can you convert a variable from a `dbl` to a `fct`
