# lifesaveR: Workbook 2

This R Markdown document is your workbook for session two of the lifesaveR module.

## Variables

The chunk below runs the calculation `40 + 2`, assigns the result to the variable `meaningoflife`, and then prints the
value of the variable.

### Exercise 1

Run the chunk below

```{r, eval=F}
# assign the current year to a variable
current_year <- 2021

# print the variable we created
# (it should display below the chunk, or in the console pane)
current_year

# do a calculation to create a new variable from an existing one
next_year <- current_year + 1
```
