# What are we trying to do?

In reporting an analysis, we're trying to achieve 5 things:

1.  Provide context
2.  Facilitate understanding
3.  Enable replication
4.  Describe the effect
5.  Answer our research question and quantify our certainty

An when doing these tasks we aim to be:

-   Complete
-   Accurate
-   Concise

# What is required

Documenting your data analysis falls into three phases:

1.  Exploratory/work in progress
2.  Interpreting your results
3.  Documenting for others

#### Exploring

When exploring and working with your own data you can work in an Rmd file as you have before, adding
code blocks as required to document everything you do, and only removing code which doesn't work or
you decide is not relevant.

#### Interpreting

When interpreting your results, you will begin to organise the analyses into a narrative. This
should answer the research questions you posed when designing the study. You can also respond to
additional questions which arise through the analyses (e.g., does your model meet the assumptions
required in regression). At this point you will be able to write the results section of your report
or article.

#### Documenting

Finally, when documenting your analyses for others, you need to create a *new* Rmd file which
focuses on the analyses required to reproduce the results in your manuscript. This simplifies the
script for others, making it easier to follow along and see how numbers in the paper were
calculated.


# The formula

Scientific journals are *extremely* formulaic; study analyses and results are reported in a very
consistent way, and this makes it relatively easy to know what to put where in your report.

For example, the journal *Psychological Science* publishes [detailed guidance on the content of each
section of manuscripts](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/ms-structure-guidelines)
acceptable for publication. There are small differences between journals (medical journals in
particular can vary a little bit) but you will always need:

-   A statement of your hypotheses [introduction]
-   A summary of your analytic approach [methods]
-   A description of the study sample [results]
-   An *exact* description of the analyses you ran [results]
-   A table describing the outputs of the model [results]
-   A description of the direction/pattern of the effects found [results]
-   A re-statement of what the main finding was [discussion]



This document [regression-reporting-example.pdf](regression-reporting-example.pdf)* contains a
worked example, along with an explanation of the different parts of the report.


:::{.exercise}

Read the [regression-reporting-example.pdf](regression-reporting-example.pdf) document.

Work with a partner to discuss the document. 

At this point,  there should only be 1 element in that document which you don't
know how to calculate. These are the confidence intervals (CI) for the model 
coefficients in Table 1, and this is covered below.
