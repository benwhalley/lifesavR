# What are we trying to do?

In reporting an analysis, we're trying to achieve 5 things:

1. Provide context
2. Facilitate understanding
3. Enable replication
4. Describe the effect
5. Answer our research question and quantify our certainty


An when doing these tasks we aim to be:

- Complete
- Accurate
- Concise




# What is required 

Documenting your data analysis falls into three phases:

1. Exploratory/work in progress
2. Interpreting your results
3. Documenting for others


When exploring and working with your own data you can work in an Rmd file as you
have before, adding code blocks as required to document everything you do, and
only removing code which doesn't work or you decide is not relevant.

When interpreting your results, you will begin to organise the analyses into a
narrative. This should answer the research questions you posed when designing
the study. You can also respond to additional questions which arise through the
analyses (e.g., does your model meet the assumptions required in regression). At
this point you will be able to write the results section of your report or
article.

Finally, when documenting your analyses for others, you need to create a *new*
Rmd file which focuses on the analyses required to reproduce the results in your
manuscript. This simplifies the script for others, making it easier to follow
along and see how numbers in the paper were calculated.



### Stick to the plan

Scientific journals are _extremely_ formulaic; study analyses and results are reported in a 
very consistent way, and this makes it relatively easy to know what to put where in your report.

For example, the journal *Psychological Science* publishes [detailed guidance on
the content of each section of
manuscripts](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/ms-structure-guidelines)
acceptable for publication. There are small differences between journals
(medical journals in particular can vary a little bit) but you will always need:

- A description of your analytic approach in the methods section
- A description of the study sample (sometimes as a table)
- An exact description of the models run
- A table describing the outputs of the model
- A description of the direction/pattern of the effects found
