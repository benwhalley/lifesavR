***Please remember that these extension exercises are _not_ required to pass the course.*** We
include them because some students work through these materials much
more quickly than others --- often because they have more previous experience with
programming --- and we aim to give all students the opportunity to stretch their skills.

If you do find you have extra time these exercises are intended to
provide additional practice in the techniques covered and to be useful
preparation for using R independently in a stage 4 or MSc research project.
