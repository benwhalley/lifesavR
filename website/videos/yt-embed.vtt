00:00:00.244 --> 00:00:12.654
This short video shows you how to run R code within a chunk. You can see here that our cursor is on line 12.

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:15.744
The cursor can be anywhere on that line.

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:26.564
Press control and enter on Windows or Linux, or command and enter on a Mac.

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:34.304
That's executed (run) line 12. There's some output in the console that you don't need to worry about for now.

00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:40.434
One of the things that this has done is loaded a data set about diamonds.

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:47.964
After running this command, the cursor's automatically positioned online 13.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:52.964
Lines 13 to 15 are actually part of the same command.

00:00:52.964 --> 00:01:03.834
We use the same keys, control and enter to run those lines.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:12.444
This runs lines 13, 14 and 15, and it produces the scatterplot based on the diamonds data set.

00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:19.704
Don't worry how these commands work at the moment, but it's very important to know that you can run parts of a command as well.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:27.844
If you select just the word diamonds on line 13 and run that, you will see that it does something different.

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:35.964
This just prints the contents of the diamonds data.

00:01:35.964 --> 00:01:44.047
The data set  is quite large, so it just prints the first few rows. So that's how you run commands and parts of commands within a chunk.
