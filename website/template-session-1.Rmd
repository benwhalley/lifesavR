```{r}
# remember to always load the tidyverse at the top of your file
# you also need to 'run' this line of code
library(tidyverse)
```



[this is an example]


EXPLANATION HERE ABOUT HOW TO USE THE FILE. WHAT `...` means etc



# Loading data

We asked you to load a datafile and make a plot

```{r}
# load the file here
thedata <- read_csv[???]

# use glimpse to check the data loaded
thedata %>% glimpse()
```



# Making a plot

Using the data we asked you to make a scatter plot with foo on the x axis and bar on the y axis:

```{r}
mydata %>% 
  ggplot ...
```




# Filtering data

Filter the mtcars data to unclude only 4 cylinder cars and save the result in a new variable:

```{r}
newvarname <-  mtcars %>% ...
```


Now make a scatter plot using only these data...

```{r}
# make a plot
newvarname %>% 
  ggplot(aes(VARIABLE, VARIABLE)) + 
  geom_point()
```
