```{r, eval=F}
# always load the libraries we need first
library(tidyverse)
library(psydata)

# see a list of columns in the dataset, and their types
iris %>% glimpse

# make a scatter plot with two continous axes
# both wt and mpg are numeric variables
# so this works well
fuel %>%
  ggplot(aes(weight, mpg)) +
    geom_point()   

# try and make a boxplot with `am` as the x-axis
# but because `cyl` is stored as a numeric variable
# (not categorical) the scale of the x-axis is wrong
fuel %>%
  ggplot(aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# re-draw the plot, but converting `cyl` to a factor/categorical
# variable first. Now the x-axis looks correct
fuel %>%
  ggplot(aes(factor(cyl), mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot()
