- In R, a **variable** is the name for a *container*
- Variables can contain anything — not just data
- ***Columns*** in a dataset sometimes get called variables too (sorry)
- Create variables with **`<-`** (called the ***assignment operator***)
- The order is: `name_of_variable <- stuff_being_stored`
- Use short, descriptive names. Don't use spaces or capitals
