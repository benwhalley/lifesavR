- We collect data to ***answer questions***
- The first step is to describe and visualise pattens in our data
- Common descriptions include measures of:
  - *central tendency* and *spread* of continuous variables (and of *differences* in these values)
  - the *frequency* of categorical responses
  - the *relationships* between variables (correlation)
- After that, we can quantify our confidence (see next workshop)
- Visualisation is an undervalued method for understanding data
