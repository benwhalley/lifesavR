- In all data there is *sampling error* or *'noise'*
- Patterns caused by noise will not replicate
- Bayes Factors quantify the evidence for patterns
- We ***compare the probability*** of two scenarios:
  i) the difference we see is 'real', and
  ii) any difference is a 'fluke'
- By convention, large Bayes Factors mean the pattern is 'real'
