- R Studio has features to help you spot errors
- Start by correcting errors that produce the yellow triangle, or red circle with white cross
- The blue triangle suggests ways to make your code more readable
- Detect errors methodically by running mini "experiments" in which you change and re-run parts of your code
- You may need to run a number of these "experiments" to detect logical and data-driven errors
- Lists of [common R errors](https://www.andywills.info/rminr/common-errors.html) can be useful
