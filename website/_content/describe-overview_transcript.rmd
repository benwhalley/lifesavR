An important task for researchers is to ***answer questions using data***.
We can often divide this activity into:

1. **Describing patterns in the data**
2. **Quantifying how *sure* we are about those patterns**


This session is all about describing and visualising patterns in the data to answer
research questions.

In this session we will cover four techniques psychologists use to answer research questions.

1. summarising numeric variables by *central tendency* and *spread*
3. calculating the *frequency* of categorical responses
2. calculating *differences* between scores or groups
3. describing *relationship* between two variables


In the past psychologists have often neglect the first part (spotting and describing patterns) and jumped
straight to the second --- for example, they have been very keen to run hypothesis tests and calculate *p* values!

A more contemporary approach places much more emphasis on describing and visualising the data, to understand it,
before trying to quantify the evidence it provides and make inferences from it.

We have already seen how to implement some of these techniques in R (e.g. using `summarise()`).
However, more important than any specific technique in R is this idea that we ***collect data to answer questions***
(not just for it's own sake!).
