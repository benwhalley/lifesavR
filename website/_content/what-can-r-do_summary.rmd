- R is a multi-purpose tool
- It is a text-based computer language
- RStudio is an *interface* to that language; it organises your work and makes R easier to use


- R can do simple arithmetic, load data, make plots etc.
- It can also run any statistical analysis you like
- You need to tell R *exactly* what to do, by providing precise instructions
- These instructions (code) provide a *reproducible record* of your work
