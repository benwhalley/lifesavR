Markdown uses special characters to style text in the same way you might use menus in a word processor to define
headings, font styles, lists etc. Your workbook contains examples of the main markdown commands you will need:

* The `#` at the start of `# lifesaveR: Workbook 1` assigns the text `lifesaveR: Workbook 1` as a first level heading (the largest size)
* The sentence below that heading is ordinary text
* `## An example plot` is a second level heading (next largest). Using `###` and `####` makes even smaller headings
* `**bold text**` makes **bold text**
* `*italic text*` makes *italic text*
* The lines beginning `1.` under `# Exercise 1` create a numbered list, starting at 1

The `Knit` button combines the markdown and R chunks, 'knitting' them together into an output document. It works through
your document converting markdown to formatted text, and running each of your R chunks, **in the order you have written
them**. You can see that this is the case by 'knitting' the R Markdown workbook for this session.

The following simple approach will give you regular practice writing markdown:

1. Each time you reach a new section in a worksheet, copy the section name (e.g. 'Exploring and checking data') into a
level 2 heading in your workbook
1. Before starting each exercise, create a level 3 heading for the exercise number [e.g. `### Exercise 5`]
1. Copy the exercise instructions below this as a bullet list
1. Add any additional notes that remind you what you have learnt in this section [e.g. `Some data is *built-in* to R.`]
1. Complete the exercise.

This methodical approach will allow you to complete each workbook step by step. At the end of each session, you will
have written a neat, 'summary' document which will be a useful revision aid. The same approach works for all R
worksheets at the University of Plymouth. If you get into this habit, you will be adding to your 'reference library'
whenever you complete a worksheet. These summary documents are invaluable when you are more familiar with R but need to
quickly remind yourself how to use a particular feature.

The [outline button] in R Studio shows you an outline of your document using the headings you have defined. This makes it easy to find a particular topic and the exercises you have completed to learn about each topic.

quick reference for markdown syntax.
