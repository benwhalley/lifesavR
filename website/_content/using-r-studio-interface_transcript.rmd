- Using a web browser to access [the RStudio Server at Plymouth University](https://rstudio.plymouth.ac.uk).

:::{.tip}
If you're using Windows or an older Mac we strongly recommend [downloading Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and using that.  If you have any issues with RStudio this is likely the first suggestion we will make.

- [Install Firefox now](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

When you login to RStudio, you'll be greeted with a screen that looks something like the image below.

You can see three parts:

1. The **Console** - This is the large rectangle on the left. It is where you tell R what to do, and where R prints the answers to your questions.

2. The **Environment** - This is the rectangle on the top right. It is where R keeps a list of the data it knows about. It's empty at the moment, because we haven't given R any data yet.

3. The **Files** - This is the rectangle on the bottom right. It's a bit like the _File Explorer_ in Windows, or the _Finder_ on a Mac. It shows you what files and folders R can see.

You should also be able to see that the two rectangles on the right have a number of other "tabs". These work like tabs on a web browser.  

The top rectangle has the tabs **Environment** and **History**. The **History** tab keeps a record of what you've recently typed into the **Console**. This can sometimes be useful.

The bottom rectangle has the tabs **Files**, **Plots**, **Packages**, **Help**, and **Viewer**. We'll cover what these other tabs do later on.
