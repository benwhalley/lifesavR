Each session has an associated "workbook" file which you will use to complete the exercises in the worksheet. The file
you need for this session is called `session-1.rmd`.

If you click on the file it opens the workbook in a tab of a new pane, called the **Source** pane. It's called the
**Source** pane because statements writting in the R language are often referred to as 'R code', which is shorthand for
'R source code'. The **source** pane allows you to write R code and explore your data.
