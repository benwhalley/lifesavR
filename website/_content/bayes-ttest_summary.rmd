- *t*-tests *compare the average score for two groups*
- A Bayes Factor from a t-test compares two hypotheses:  
  - H$_1$: the groups are *different*, vs.
  - H$_0$: the groups are *identical*
- Use the `ttestBF` function in R  (load `BayesFactor` first)
- Bayes Factors range from zero to infinity
- Large Bayes Factors are evidence ***for some difference***
- Use a boxplot to check the *direction* of any difference
