- A scatterplot shows the *relationship* between two *continuous* variables (columns)
- Each observation (row) must have at least two values (so we need two columns)
- These define the position of a point on the x and y axes of the plot
- Use `ggplot()`
- `aes(x = ..., y = ...)` chooses the x and y data *columns* and creates the axes
- `geom_point()` adds the points
