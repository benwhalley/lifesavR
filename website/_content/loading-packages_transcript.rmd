By loading 'packages', you can add extra functions and datasets to R.

Packages are a powerful feature which allow R to be extended. This means you can run almost
any analysis, or make any type of plot.

Packages are loaded using the `library()` function.

The first function you ran above was `library(tidyverse)`.  This loaded additional functions
you need to make a scatter plot.

**The `tidyverse` package is so fundamental to this course that `library(tidyverse)` is
likely to be the first line of R code, in the first chunk, in all your RMarkdown files.**

It's a good idea to load packages at the **top** of your R code files. This makes it
easy to see which have been loaded, and avoids loading them twice which is occasionally
a problem.

You do need to remember to actually **run** the lines of code to load libraries though.
Beginners often forget to do this — but it's an easy error to fix.
