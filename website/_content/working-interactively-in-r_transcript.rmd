In an earlier video we introduced RMarkdown. In this clip, we recap on some useful things
to know when using RMarkdown files in RStudio. It's intended as a kind of reference
for later on.

- Running just part of a statement
- Run a whole chunk using `Cmd+Shift+Enter` or `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` (Windows)
- How R knows where statements start and end
- The importance of blank lines
- Loading packages first



Running parts of statements:

```{r}
happy %>%
  filter(year==2018) %>%
  ggplot(aes(gdp_per_capita, happiness)) +
  geom_point()
```


- Demonstrate selecting each part in turn again
- Point out that we can check what data has been sent to the plot and amend if necessary
- Demonstrate making an error where column is misspelled
