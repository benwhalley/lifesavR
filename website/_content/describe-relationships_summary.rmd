- With 2 continuous variables we can also describe a *relationships* between them:
  - Scatterplots (using `geom_point()`)
  - Correlations (using `correlate()` and `correlationBF`)
- For correlations, the relationship must be *linear* (check with plot)
- Correlations describe the ***strength of the relationship*** (< 0.3 is weak; >.7 is strong)
- A Bayes Factor describes the ***strength of the evidence*** (>3 is considered good)
- If we collect lots of data we could have *strong* evidence for a *weak*
relationship. With a small dataset we might only have weak evidence for a strong
relationship.
