1. Open `session-4.rmd` using the **Files** pane. This is the workbook you will be using in this session.
TODO XXX VERY SIMPLE REVISION EXERCISES IN WORKBOOK
- USING GROUP_BY AND SUMARISE
- MAKING A BOXPLOT WITH A DEMO DATASET

:::


:::{.exercise}

TODO XXX
- in your workbook
- use mutate to create a variable representing weight lost between baseline and end of follow-up in the funimagery data
- make a boxplot of these data

:::


# The *frequency* of responses


```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "describe-frequency", ytidentifier = "yt-embed")
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```


:::{.exercise}

- Use the `funimagery` data.
- Use `count()` to count how many participants there were in each intervention group
- How many men were in the FIT group?


<!-- funimagery %>% count(intervention, gender) -->

:::




# Relationships

```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "describe-relationships", ytidentifier = "yt-embed")
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```



:::{.exercise}

- Remember to load the `corrr` package (use the `library` function)
- Use the `fuel` dataset from the `psydata` package
- What is the correlation between `power` and `engine_size`?

:::





:::{.exercise}

It's helpful to get a feel for what the data would look like for different correlation coefficients.
<http://guessthecorrelation.com> is a game designed to help with this.

- The game shows you a scatterplot; your job is to guess the correlation coefficient.
- Try and get to about 30 points without losing any lives!  If you like you can get competitive and play a two-player game!

# Extension exercises


```{r, child="_content/extension-exercises-premable.rmd"}
```


:::{.exercise}


Correlations require that there is a *linear relationship* between the two variables. That is, the pattern in a scatterplot should be fair close to a straight line.

- Plot pairs of variables from the `fuel` dataset.
- Which pairs would be NOT be suitable to use to calculate a correlation?

`r hide()`

Engine size and MPG would be one example. There is a curved relationship between them:

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
fuel %>% ggplot(aes(engine_size, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm, formula=y~poly(x, 2), se=F)
```

The problem here is that a single straight line isn't appropriate for the data: The slope is
much less steep at the right hand side of the plot, but the correlation doesn't capture that, so
it's not a good statistic to describe the pattern we see here.



`r unhide()`

# Check your knowledge

Write an answer to each of these questions in the `Check your knowledge` section of your workbook. The answers will be
revealed in Session 5.
