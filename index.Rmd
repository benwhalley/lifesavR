> LifesaveR is a short course in statistics and data visualisation R.


R is a bit like a martial art (yes, this is a bit corny, but we think the parallels are real. If you don't find the analogy useful feel free to ignore it, but it might be helpful to some).

- As a beginner you learn basic moves and simple techniques for self defence. If an attacker does _just_ what you expect you can block or counter-attack. But if something unexpected happens you might be confused or overwhelmed.

- As you gain expertise you learn general principles of movement and strategy. These let you to respond flexibly â€” so when things don't unfold as you expect you are able to adapt and make good decisions.

- Finally, you become a master. You begin to see connections between techniques and can suggest new combinations or patterns to defeat even sophisticated attacks.


This is all the same with R. To begin with we show you the basics, but if the data aren't in the right format, or something unexpected happens you can end up stuck. In this course we aim to give you more general principles for working with data. Over time you will develop understanding and expertise that lets you combine techniques to solve new problems.

Another way R and martial arts are similar is that there's no substitute for practice. It's not possible to 'fake it'. A punch to the face is direct and effective feedback that basic skills like blocking or footwork need practice. In R, error messages and broken code can also feel unforgiving. The solution (in both cases) is to ensure the basics are correct, and more deliberate practice. 




# Using these worksheets

These worksheets are designed based on student feedback over several years. Our strategy is to:

- state and show key techniques with the minimum of explanation
- give an expanded explanation in a video (video transcripts are available to read)
- ask you to complete simple exercises to follow along (sometimes by copying an pasting code)
- ask you to complete additional problems to check your understanding (here, you edit the code)

:::{.exercise}

Exercises and problems are presented in Blue boxes, like this.

**It's important to complete all the exercises.**

:::


For each session there is an interactive workbook (explained below) which you should use to organise your work.


## Mindset matters

<!-- TODO BEN intro VIDEO -->

`r hide('Video script')`
I wonder if a video of Ben explaining success factors might be a replacement for the martial arts simile.

For now, this is a list of success factors observed in previous cohorts:

* 'Light' attitude
* Perseverence
* Go slow. Don't move on until you've understood each section
* It's not a race or a competition with your peers (even if workshops can feel that way)
  * Hare and the tortoise
* ork iSupport each other, but make sure _you_ are doing the work too.
* Do all exercises
* Re-do parts of worksheet if you didn't understand them
* Work together
* Many instances of people who overcame initial lack of confidence to enjoy R
* Practise - learn by doing
`r unhide()`




# Access to R

Throughout the module we use R for data processing and analysis.

If you are taking this course at Plymouth University, the easiest way to run the code
examples here is to the school's RStudio Server.

-   [Login to your account on the server here](https://rstudio.plymouth.ac.uk)


### Installing at home

If you want to install R on your own machine, instructions are available here:

-   <https://github.com/plymouthPsychology/installR/>

Be sure to install the recommended packages or the examples given here won't work.
