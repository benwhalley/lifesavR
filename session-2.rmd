# Overview

**Make sure you are confident with all the material in the [previous session](session-1.html) before continuing.**

Here we introduce extra tricks for working
with RStudio that are important to build confidence and make you productive.

At the end of the session, you will have used variables to store the result of your calculations,
loaded data into R from a file, and used commands to select and summarise
subsets of the data. These are important building blocks for later sessions.


# Techniques covered

- [Storing data in variables](#variables)
- [Passing data with pipes `%>%`](#pipe)
- [Loading data from elsewhere](#loadingdata)
- [The **Files** pane](#filespane)
- [Uploading data files](#upload)
- [Selecting rows with `filter()`](#filter)
- [Summarising data using `summarise()`](#summarise)
- [R comments](#comments)

<!-- Activity: -->

<!-- ???  set up the teaching as a kind of treasure hunt where students have to find use data to answer questions, gather -->
<!-- clues and spell out a word? Alternatively, just ask them to make *LOTs* of different plots using the techniques above, not -->
<!-- just one: -->


# Variables {#variables}

```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "variables", ytidentifier = "yt-embed")
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```

:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 1**

1. Open `session-2.rmd` using the **Files** pane. This is the workbook you will be using in this session.
1. Run the first chunk in the workbook.

The output should look like this:

![Chunk which creates variables and prints a variable's value](images/variables.png)

Your **Environment** pane should look like this:

![Environment pane after creating variables](images/environment_variables.png)
:::

:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 2**

1. Create a level 3 markdown heading named "Exercise 2" in your workbook
1. Create a new chunk beneath the heading
1. Assign the results of the calculation `2 * 35` to the variable `seventy`
1. Run the chunk

Your **Environment** should now look like this:

![Environment pane after creating new variable](images/environment2.png)

:::

:::{.exercise}

**Exercise 3**

1. Create a level 3 markdown heading named "Exercise 3" in your workbook
1. Use R to calculate your age in the year 2051.
1. Save the result in a variable _with a descriptive name_.
:::

# Pipes: `%>%` {#pipe}

```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "pipes", ytidentifier = "yt-embed")
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```

:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 4**

1. Create a level 3 markdown heading named "Exercise 4" in your workbook. (You should be used to doing this for every exercise by now, so we won't remind you again.)  <!-- TODO is this true enough yet? -->
1. Create a new code chunk beneath this heading.
1. Load the `tidyverse` library.
1. Pipe the `mpg` `data.frame` into `head()` and assign the results to a variable called `mpg_head`.
1. Use the **Environment** pane to open `mpg_head`.
In 1999, a 6-cylinder, manual transmission, Audio A4 could cover `r fitb('18')` miles per gallon when driven in the
city.
:::


# Loading data {#loadingdata}

```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "loading-data", ytidentifier = "yt-embed", showcode=F)
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```




:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 5**

1. Create a new chunk.
1. Read the data stored at <https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/lifesavr/shootings.csv>
1. View it using the **Environment** pane.
1. View it using `glimpse()`.
:::




:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 6**

1. Use your web browser to download <https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/lifesavr/shootings.csv> to your computer.
1. Upload `shootings.csv` to the server.
1. Create a new code chunk in your workbook.
1. Read `shootings.csv` into a variable with a descriptive name.

In which city was the earliest recorded shooting? `r fitb('Shelton')`
:::





# Selecting rows {#filter}


```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "filter", ytidentifier = "yt-embed", showcode=F)
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```







:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 7**

Filter `gapminder` to show countries with a population greater than 100 million.

Your results should look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
development %>% filter(population > 100000000)
```

:::

:::{.exercise}

**Exercise 8**

Show countries with a population greater than 100 million and life expectancy greater than 70.

The results should look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
development %>%
  filter(population > 100000000) %>%
  filter(life_expectancy > 70)
```

:::


# Summarising data {#summarise}


```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "summarise", ytidentifier = "yt-embed", showcode=F)
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```



:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 13**

1. Copy the code above into your workbook.
1. Amend the code to calculate the median weight.
1. Note that `fuel` stores `weight` in kilos.

The median car weight is `r fitb(median(fuel$weight))` kg


**Exercise 14**

1. Amend the code to calculate the mean and standard deviation of `weight`.

To the nearest pound, the mean car weight is `r fitb(round(median(fuel$weight), 0))` kg, and the standard deviation is `r fitb(round(sd(fuel$weight), 0))` kg.
:::



:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 15**

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=T}
sd6 <- fuel %>%
  filter(cyl == 6) %>%
  summarise(x = sd(mpg)) %>% pull(x) 

mubig <- fuel %>%
  filter(engine_size > 3000) %>%
  summarise(x = mean(mpg)) %>% pull(x) 

```
Use `filter()` and `summarise()` together to calculate the answers to these questions to 1 decimal place:

- the average MPG of cars with engine size > 3000:  `r fitb(mubig, tol=.1)`
- the standard deviation of MPG in cars with 6 gears: `r fitb(sd6, tol=.1)`


:::


# Check your knowledge

Write an answer to each of these questions in the `Check your knowledge` section of your workbook. The answers will be
revealed in Session 3.

1. What is the `<-` symbol called and what does it do?
1. What is the `%>%` symbol called and what does it do?
1. Which function is used to load data from a CSV file?
1. How would you select rows from a dataset where values in a numeric column are between 10 and 20?
1. Which functions would you use to calculate the mean of a numeric column?



# Extension exercises

XXX NEED TO ADD A NEW PAIR BECAUSE I TOOK OUT ARRANGE AND GROUP BY



<!-- TODO: Ben: need to chat more to finish this and other "fix script" tasks -->

# Broken script to fix

Start a NEW R session and make this code work:

```{r, eval=F}
liibrary(todyverse)

# select only years after 1990
development %>%
  filter(year > "1990")

# calculate the average life expectancy in Africa
development 
  filter(continent = "africa") %>% 
  summarise(average(life_expectancy))

ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_jitter()
```

NOTE - we will know all the errors they will see so can provide hints for each of them

```{r}
# correct version
library(tidyverse)

# select only years after 1990
development %>%
  filter(year > 1990)

# calculate the average life expectancy in Africa
development %>% 
  filter(continent == "Africa") %>% 
  summarise(mean(life_expectancy))

development %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, color=continent)) +
  geom_point()
```
