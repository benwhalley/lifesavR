Each column in a dataset has an associated type. The second column of the `glimpse` output shows you the type of each column. This dataset includes columns with two types:

* `dbl` is short for 'double-precision number', a number with one or more decimal places
* `chr` — short for 'character', a variable which contains text (e.g. an email address)

Other types include:

* `fct` is short for 'factor', a categorical variable (e.g. a specific response to a multiple-choice question)
* `int` is short for 'integer', a variable which contains whole numbers (e.g. a participant id number), and
* `ord` — short for 'ordered'; a variant of *fct* where the categories have a particular order (e.g. responses like 'Wost' < 'Better' < 'Best')

The importance of knowing the type associated with a column will become clear in a later session.

# Sorting data using `arrange()` {#arrange}

![TODO: replace with video](images/video_placeholder.png)

### Video summary

- The `arrange()` function sorts rows in a dataset.
- Give `arrange()` a single column name to sort data in ascending order.
- To sort in descending order, put a `-` before the column name.
- Use commas between column names to sort by more than once column at once


### Code examples

```{r}
# sort by carat in ascending order
diamonds %>%
  arrange(carat) %>%
  head(3)

# sort by carat in descending order (spot the minus sign in front of 'caret')
diamonds %>%
  arrange(-carat) %>%
  head(3)

# sort by price (descending) within carat (ascending)
diamonds %>%
  arrange(carat, -price)
```

`r hide('Show full video transcript and code')`

TODO ADD PREAMBLE / RATIONALE FOR THIS
SORTING IS A WAY TO GET MIN/MAX and INSPECT IN A TABLE

Sort by carat in ascending order

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  arrange(carat) %>%
  head(3)
```

Sort by carat in descending order

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  arrange(-carat) %>%
  head(3)
```

Sort by price (descending) within carat (ascending)

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  arrange(carat, -price)
```
`r unhide()`

:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 9**

1. Sort the `diamonds` dataset by ascending price.
1. Show only the first five rows of the results.

Your answer should look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  arrange(price) %>%
  head(5)
```

:::


:::{.exercise}

**Exercise 10**

How big is the largest diamond in the `diamonds` dataset? `r fitb('5.01')` carats.

What was the cut of the three largest diamonds in that dataset? `r fitb('Fair')`.

# Combine `filter()` with `arrange()` {#filterarrange}

![TODO: replace with video](images/video_placeholder.png)

### Video summary

- Pipelines combine functions to answer specific questions.
- A good example of this is combining `filter()` and `arrange()`.

### Code examples

```{r}
# show which years Kenyans had their lowest life expectancy
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Kenya") %>%
  arrange(lifeExp) %>%
  head(6)

# show which year Kenyans with their life expectancy (just add '-')
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Kenya") %>%
  arrange(-lifeExp) %>%
  head(6)
```

`r hide('Show full video transcript and code')`
What was the year Kenyans had the lowest life exp:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Kenya") %>%
  arrange(lifeExp) %>%
  head(6)
```

What was the highest year? All that changes is the minus sign (reverse sorting)

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Kenya") %>%
  arrange(-lifeExp) %>%
  head(6)
```

`r unhide()`

:::{.exercise}

**Exercise 11**

1. Sort all Asian countries in the `gapminder` dataset in ascending population order.
1. Show only the first 10 rows.

Your results should look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder::gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  arrange(pop) %>%
  head(10)
```

**Exercise 12**

Use `filter()`, `arrange()` and `head()` to answer the following questions:

The European country with the highest life expectancy is `r fitb('Iceland')`.

The European country with the fifth largest population was recorded in which year? `r fitb('2007')`.

PAUL - I'M WORRIED WEAKER STUDENTS WON'T GET THIS FAR.

PERHAPS WE SHOULD PUSH SUMMARISE INTO SESSION 3? I CERTAINLY THINK THIS IS TRUE FOR GROUP-BY

WE CAN MOTIVATE THIS BY FINDING LONG FORM DATA WE WANT TO SUMMARISE THEN RUN A T TEST ON.


CAN YOU HAVE A THINK ABOUT HOW LONG EACH OF THE VIDEOS MIGHT RUN FOR? IF STUDENTS WATCHED ALL OF THEM WOULD IT TAKE > 1 HOUR? I THINK WE SHOULD PERHAPS AIM FOR VIDEOS TOTALLING <40 MINS, THEN EXPECT EXERCISES TO TAKE 40 MINS....
I WILL HAVE ANOTHER READ THROUGH TOO



ALTERNATIVELY, WE CAN SHOW THIS HERE AND THEN REPEAT AGAIN IN SESSION 3 TO DO THE T TEST... THAT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD



The last two exercises are like the end of level "boss characters" in a computer game. To beat them, you need to select
and combine skills you've learnt so far.


## Extension exercise 1

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
gapminder::gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952) %>%
  arrange(-lifeExp) %>%
  head(1)
```

The country with the highest life expectancy in 1952 was `r fitb('Norway')`. (Hint: use `arrange()`, `filter()` and
`head()` with the `gapminder` dataset.)

## Extension exercise 2

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
gapminder::gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  filter(year == "1987") %>%
  summarise(average_gdp = mean(gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(-average_gdp)
```

The continent with the highest mean per capita GDP in 1987 was `r fitb('Oceania')`. (Hint: use `filter()`, `arrange()`,
`group_by()`, and `summarise()`.)

## Extension exercise 4

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
  filter(year < "2000") %>%
  arrange(-pop, lifeExp)
```

Before the year 2000, the African country with the largest population and the lowest life expectancy was
`r fitb('Nigeria')`.

## Extension exercise 5

Make a table which shows the average life expectancy for each continent, sorted from highest to lowest. It should look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(life_expectancy = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  arrange(-life_expectancy)
```


#### SORT AND ARRANGE CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE QUESTIONS
1. How would you sort a `data.frame` by a numeric column in descending order? <!-- TODO: too easy? -->
1. How would you select rows from a column which match a word, and then sort those rows in ascending order by a numeric column?















Some martial arts have a concept called 'Mushin'. A literal translation of this is 'mind without mind'. It denotes a state of mind achieved when free from thoughts of anger, fear, or ego, during combat or in everyday life. To achieve mushin takes **repeated practice** and complete familiarity with the technique required to act, so that technical details can fade into the background.

We think there is an analogy to learning R here:

- If you are anxious, stressed or avoidant you will be distracted and find it harder to learn.
- Getting confident with the basics makes more complex techniques possible.

This session is about building skills and mastering core techniques. We will use these skills throughout the course. If
some parts are already familiar to you, that's fine.  If it is all new, be sure to complete all the exercises/practice
problems.
