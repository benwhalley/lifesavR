# Do it: Bayesian t test

## Exercise 1

> 1. Use the `funimagery` dataset.
> 2. Plot participants' weights at baseline (`kg1`) in each intervention group.
> 3. Use `summarise()` to calculate the difference between the groups weight.
> 4. Use `with()` and `ttestBF()` to calculate the Bayes Factor for this difference.

## What hypotheses are being compared when we calculate a Bayes Factor for a correlation?

## Which function do we recommend to calculate correlation coefficients?

## Which function calculates the Bayes Factor for a correlation?

## Which function calculates the Bayes Factor for a difference in the average of two groups?

## What direction slope does a correlation of -0.5 imply? What would the scatterplot look like?

## What conclusion should we draw if the Bayes Factor for a correlation is 2.1? How about if it was 0.21, or 210?

## What conclusion should we draw if the Bayes Factor for a t test is 0.8? How about if it were > 10?

## What is the difference between `ttestBF()` and `correlationBF()`?
