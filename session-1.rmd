# Overview

<!-- > Beginners mind (Shoshin) denotes openness, eagerness and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, just as a beginner would, no matter what level of expertise the student has.  -->

<!-- Even black belt martial artists practice basic techniques like blocks and punches every time they train. -->

This session doesn't assume any prior knowledge of R, and introduces the basics. For some students this will include revision of material from stage 1. However we provide additional material for advanced students to test their knowledge and extend familiar skills.

To be clear, this repetition is intentional: we find most students will benefit from refreshing their knowledge at this stage in the course. **Even if you are quite confident when using RStudio please read the worksheet carefully and complete all of
the activities in the blue boxes.**

# R techniques covered

- [Using the RStudio interface](#using)
- [What can R do?](#cando)
- [Working interactively in R Markdown](#interactive)
- [Creating a chunk](#chunk)

- [Introduction to Markdown](#markdown)






# Using the RStudio interface {#using}


```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "using-r-studio-interface", ytidentifier = "yt-embed", showcode=F)
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```







# Before you start

```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "before-you-start", ytidentifier = "yt-embed")
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```


:::{.exercise}

1. Click on the **Console** pane.
1. Copy-paste the following into the console:

`source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/lifesavR/main/bootstrap.R")`

Your console should now look like this:

![](images/bootstrap_command.png)
Press <span class="keyshape">↩</span> to run the code. If your console looks like the image below, then you are ready to start the session.

# Using the workbooks

```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "using-the-workbooks",
                   showcode = F,
                   ytidentifier = "yt-embed")
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```


:::{.exercise}

Click on `session-1.rmd` in the **Files** pane.

If you're able to open this file you are now ready to start the rest of the session.

:::



# What can R do? {#cando}

```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "what-can-r-do", ytidentifier = "yt-embed")
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```



# Working interactively in R Markdown {#interactive}

```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "working-interactively-in-r", ytidentifier = "yt-embed", showcode=F)
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```



:::{.exercise}

**Exercise 1**

1. Locate the first chunk in `session-1.rmd` (you find this in the 'files' pane)
1. Place your cursor (anywhere) on the line that says `library(tidyverse)`
1. Run the code by pressing <span class="keyshape">Ctrl</span> + <span class="keyshape">↵</span> (Windows, Linux) or
<span class="keyshape">⌘</span> + <span class="keyshape">↩</span> (Mac)

You will see some output appear beneath the chunk. Don't worry about the details for now, we'll explain those later.

:::


:::{.exercise}

**Exercise 2**

Position your cursor on the line that says `diamonds` and run the code.

You should see the following scatter plot of the diamonds data appear below the chunk:

```{r diamonds-plot, echo=FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point()
```


:::


Congratulations! You have just run your first lines of R. The code to produce the plot consisted of three lines. You can
also run part of a line by highlighting just the code you want to run, as you'll see in the next exercise.




:::{.exercise}

**Exercise 3**

1. Select (highlight) the word `diamonds`.
1. Run the code.

This prints the first few lines of the diamonds data:

![Example of running highlighted code](images/diamonds.png)

:::




:::{.exercise}

**Exercise 4: Making new chunks**

1. Find the instructions for Exercise 4 in your workbook.
1. Create a new chunk below the instructions.
1. Inside the chunk, write a line of code which adds together the numbers 9, 4, 55 and 2, and assigns the result to a variable named `totalscore`.
1. Run the the line of code you have written.

After completing these steps, your environment should look like this:


<!-- XXX TODO PAUL this image needs changing to read totalscore not sum and also shouldn't have meaningoflife any more -->

![Environment after Exercise 1](images/ex1.png)

# Loading packages {#packages}

```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "loading-packages", ytidentifier = "yt-embed")
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```



:::{.tip}

If you've understood what packages are then it should be clear that you can't use the functions provided by `tidyverse`
until you've run the command: `library(tidyverse)`.

For example, if you tried to produce the scatter plot before loading `tidyverse` you'd see an error like this in the
console:

<pre style="color:red">
Error in diamonds %>% ggplot(aes(carat, price, colour = clarity)) :
  could not find function "%>%"
</pre>

**This is important** because `could not find function` errors are one of the most common problems
that beginners encounter. They normally mean that you have

1. forgotten to include `library(tidyverse)` as the first line in your code, or
1. forgotten to *run* that line.

:::




# Datasets {#datasets}



```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "built-in-datasets", ytidentifier = "yt-embed")
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```



:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 5**

1. Create a new chunk at the bottom of your workbook.
1. Display the `mtcars` `data.frame` and try out the navigation buttons.
1. Load the `gapminder` package.
1. Display and explore the `gapminder` dataset.
:::




:::{.exercise}
**Exercise 6**

1. Create a new chunk at the bottom of your worksheet.
1. Use `head()` to show the first six rows of `gapminder`.

Use the output to answer the following question. After entering your answer, click outside the box. The border will turn
turn blue when the answer is correct.

The population of Afghanistan in 1967 was `r fitb('11537966')`.

**Exercise 7**

1. Create a new chunk at the bottom of your worksheet.
1. Use `glimpse` to display the `diamonds` dataset.

The `clarity` variable in the `diamonds` tibble is of type `r fitb('ord')`.
:::



# Scatterplots  {#scatterplots}


```{r, echo=F}
video_data <- list(identifier = "scatterplots", ytidentifier = "yt-embed")
# makermds(video_data)
```

```{r child = '_content/_video_tabs.rmd'}
```



:::{.exercise}

**Exercise 8**

1. Create a new chunk at the bottom of your worksheet.
1. Create a scatterplot with `displ` (engine 'displacement') on the x-axis and `hwy` on the y-axis.
1. Run the chunk.

The scatterplot should look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mpg %>% ggplot(aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```
:::




<!-- markdown moved to later session -->



# Check your knowledge

Write an answer to each of these questions in the `Check your knowledge` section of your workbook. The answers will be
revealed in Session 2.

1. How do you run part of a line of R code (using the keyboard short cut)?
1. Which library do you usually need to load in your first R Markdown chunk?
1. What is `gapminder`?
1. Which function would you use to explore the first few rows of a dataset?
1. What is the 5th column in `gapminder`?
1. Explain what `glimpse` does.
1. Which function makes a plot?  (there are many, but we mean the one shown in this worksheet)
1. Which function defines the axes on a plot?



# Extension exercises

:::{.exercise}

### Extension exercise XXX

This scatterplot uses the `mpg` dataset to show `displ` (displacement) on the x-axis against `cty` (mpg when driving in
a city) on the y-axis.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mpg %>% ggplot(aes(displ, cty)) +
  geom_point()
```

In a new chunk, write the R code to produce this plot.
